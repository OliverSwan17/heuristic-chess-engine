<h1 id="codebase-primer">Codebase Primer</h1>
<p>The intention of this documentation is provide an overview of how the
codebase is layed out and operates. Reading this should provide you with
a general feel on how the engine operates.</p>
<p>The codebase has a simple layout wherein source files are in the
<code>src</code> directory, header files in <code>include</code>, and
object files in <code>obj</code>. The repository makes use of various
branches. The <code>staging</code> branch is used for changes that are
still being tested before they are deemed fit to be merged with
main.</p>
<p>As the project progresses branches will be created for different
iterations of the engine. The first of these branches will simply be an
AI which produces moves randomly. With each subsequent major iteration
having its own branch that will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>This use of branches will make it easy for benchmarking and comparing
the performance of different iterations against each other.</p>
<h2 id="piece-representation">Piece Representation</h2>
<p>The pieces are represented using a <code>uint8_t</code>. Bits zero
through three represent the piece type.</p>

<p>The remaining four bits could potentially be used to indicate if
en-passant is available and if the king has moved, the rook has moved
etc.</p>
<p>There is a macro defined in <code>chess.h</code> which is used to
calculate the colour of a piece. If positive, the piece is white and if
zero the piece is black. This is calculated through simply checking if
the fourth bit is set using a bitmask.</p>

<h2 id="board-representation">Board Representation</h2>
<h3 id="the-board-data-structure">The Board Data Structure</h3>
<p>The board is simply represented by an array of 64
<code>uint8_t</code>. With each value byte representing a piece. The
following images show the indicies of the pieces and the initial board
state.</p>
<p><img src="board_indices.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p><img src="board.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>The board is initialised in <code>main.c</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode C"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">uint8_t</span><span class="op">*</span> board <span class="op">=</span> fenToArray<span class="op">(</span><span class="st">&quot;rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR&quot;</span><span class="op">);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The board is allocated memory on the heap from the following call to
malloc in the <code>fenToArray</code> function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode C"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">uint8_t</span><span class="op">*</span> board <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">(</span><span class="dt">uint8_t</span><span class="op">*)</span>malloc<span class="op">(</span><span class="dv">64</span> <span class="op">*</span> <span class="kw">sizeof</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="dt">uint8_t</span><span class="op">));</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="piece-orientation-and-directions">Piece Orientation and
Directions</h3>
<p>Piece orientation is important for pawn moves as black pawns will
move in the positive direction and white pawns will move in the negative
direction. Therefore, the codebase makes use of directions relative to
the colour of the pawn. Anterior is forward, posterior is backwards,
dextral is right and sinistral is left. The directions are shown below
and defined in <code>chess.h</code>:</p>

<p>Macros are employed to calculate these positions given an index and
direction. With the direction being either 1 for the black facing
direction or -1 for the white facing direction.</p>
<h3 id="files-and-ranks">Files and Ranks</h3>
<p>The files run vertically and the ranks run horizontally. There are
some macros defined in <code>chess.h</code> that calculate the rank and
file given an index. These macros are shown below:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode C"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="pp">#define FILE</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="pp">i</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="pp"> </span><span class="op">(((</span><span class="pp">i</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="pp"> </span><span class="op">%</span><span class="pp"> </span><span class="dv">8</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="pp"> </span><span class="op">+</span><span class="pp"> </span><span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">)</span></span>

<p>Understanding these calculations is made much easier when referring
to the <code>board_indices.png</code> image. The A file is represented
by 1 and the first rank is represented by 1 also. Then it is easy to see
why the calculation for the file is simply the index modulo 8, plus
1.</p>
<p>The calculation for rank is a bit more tricky. I forgot how I came up
with it but I'm sure you can figure it out by looking at it.</p>
<h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2>
<p>The graphics for this program is driven by SDL2. Documentation for
this library can be found here: <a
href="https://www.libsdl.org/">https://www.libsdl.org/</a>.</p>
<p>SDL2 uses a left-handed coordinate system, meaning that (0, 0) refers
to the pixel at the top-left corner of the screen. Moving to (1, 0)
places you one pixel to the right, while (0, 1) moves you one pixel
down.</p>
<h3 id="sprites">Sprites</h3>
<p>The piece images are shown in the following sprite sheet under the
<code>assets/pieces</code> directory.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/pieces/pieces.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>Each piece is 20x20 pixels. Most of the UI functionality is defined
in <code>draw.c</code>. The main data structures for drawing the board
and pieces are:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode C"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>SDL_Rect<span class="op">*</span> squaresRects<span class="op">[</span><span class="dv">64</span><span class="op">];</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>SDL_Rect<span class="op">*</span> piecesRects<span class="op">[</span><span class="dv">12</span><span class="op">];</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>SDL_Texture<span class="op">*</span> piecesTexture<span class="op">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>SDL_Rect</code> struct defines a rectangular area in which
sprites are printed to the screen. Therefore, we define 64 rects; one
for each square. We also define 12 rects; one for each piece/colour
combination. These 12 rects will be assigned to each piece in the
spritesheet within <code>piecesRects</code>. This will allow us to use
these rects as a source to copy from with the destination being defined
in <code>squaresRects</code>.</p>
<p>The drawing is enabled through calling various SDL2 functions which
is fairly simple.</p>
<h3 id="the-screen">The Screen</h3>
<p>The screen is simply just the board in a 800x800 pixel window. This
means that each piece is upscaled from 20x20 pixels by 5 to 100x100
pixels.</p>
<h2 id="forsythedwards-notation-fen">Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN)</h2>
<p>This notation is used to describe the state of the board and castling
availability as well as a possible En passant target square. The half
move, full move count as well as the active colour is also described.
More can be read about FEN here: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation</a>.</p>
<p>The initial state of the board is given by the following FEN string:
<code>rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1</code></p>
<p>As you can see, each integer simply represents a run of empty
squares. White pieces are denoted using uppercase and black pieces
lowercase.</p>
<p><code>uint8_t* fenToArray(char* fen)</code> within <code>fen.c</code>
takes a FEN string, allocates 64 bytes of memory on the heap, fills
allocation with the required piece values, and returns a pointer to
it.</p>
<h2 id="move-generation">Move Generation</h2>
<p>The move generation functionality is implemented in moves.c. To
generate moves for a given piece, the naive approach is to first
calculate all potential target squares for that piece. Next, we simulate
the move and calculate the target squares of all opposing pieces. If the
opposing pieces can attack the king in this scenario, the move is marked
as illegal and removed from the list of target squares. By repeating
this process for all target squares, we obtain the final set of legal
moves for that piece.</p>
<p>This approach is rather inefficient and is subject to change.
However, it is important in such a project that we do not prematurely
optimise everything. It is more important that we first get the program
functional and then perform iterations over time.</p>
<p>The move generation is handled by the
<code>uint64_t getMoves(uint8_t* board, uint8_t pieceIndex)</code>
function in <code>moves.c</code>. This function will call a helper
function that is associated with each piece type to generate the moves.
For example, the call getMoves(board, 25) will lookup the piece at the
25th index in board and if it is a pawn, will then call
<code>pawnTargetSquares</code>.</p>
<p>It should be noted that some of the move generation code is rather
cryptic. However, if you go through it and constantly refer to the board
indices image, things become more clear.</p>
<h3 id="target-squares">Target Squares</h3>
<p>A piece's "target squares" are all the squares it can attack,
excluding those occupied by pieces of the same color. These target
squares are represented using a <code>uint64_t</code>, a 64-bit unsigned
integer. This is ideal because each bit in the integer corresponds to a
specific square on the board, indicating whether it is under attack.
This representation also allows easy calculation of all squares attacked
by a player’s pieces by combining individual target squares with bitwise
OR operations.</p>
<p>The <code>getMoves</code> function will simply return by value an
<code>uint64_t</code> which represents a given pieces target
squares.</p>
<h2 id="networking-and-matchmaking">Networking and Matchmaking</h2>
<p>This codebase provides support for both windows and linux based
operating systems. The following descriptions are agnostic to the
underlying operating system for simplicity. Both operating systems have
their own implementations located at: <code>src/linux_networking</code>
and <code>src/windows_networking</code>. Currently, there are two
implementations for the server. However, each server in theory should be
able to handle clients of different operating systems.</p>
<p>The main advantage of using a socket based system for matchmaking is
that the server is agnostic to the client. For example, we can have
human vs human, human vs AI, and AI vs AI. Each of these combinations
have their uses. AI vs AI can be used to benchmark different iterations
of the engine.</p>
<p>UDP is used as the transport layer protocol.</p>
<h3 id="the-server">The Server</h3>
<p>The server code is very simple and defined as <code>server.c</code>.
It first waits till it has two connections. Assinging the first
connection it receives the colour black, and the second connection the
colour white. The server will then wait till it receives 64 bytes from
the white client, indicating the new board state containing the first
move. The server will then forward this board state to the black client.
The black client at this stage will have updated their client to show
whites first move. Following this, the server will wait for blacks
response and forward it onto white. White will then update their board
state and make their move. The server then repeats this process forever.
The server in the future will have to facilitate the various different
endings to the game that are yet to be implemented.</p>
<h3 id="the-client-code--move-synchronisation-code">The Client Code /
Move Synchronisation Code</h3>
<p>The client connects to the server through OS specific code defined in
<code>main.c</code> through ifdefs. This includes creating a thread
which handles the move synchronisation. This thread is the crux of the
clients interaction with the server. This threads functionality is
defined in <code>move_sync.c</code>. The client first sends a blank UDP
packet to the server to establish the connection so the server knows of
the client. The client will then receive a packet indicating the clients
colour. If black the client will then wait to receive whites first move.
If white, the client will send the first move to the server and then
wait to recive blacks move. These steps are done manually in the code.
The client then continually sends and receives in a loop as it should be
synchronised with the other client. This works because the white client
will send then enter the loop, while the black client will receive, then
send, then enter the loop. The specifics of mutual exclusion and
handling concurrency issues is specific to the operating system and
understood more easily by reading the code.</p>
